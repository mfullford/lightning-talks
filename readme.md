# Lightning Talks

Your goal is to create a 5-minute presentation on a topic that is useful to your fellow developers. Please create a brief readme on Github outlining your findings during your research. It should address the following:

- What problem does this technology solve?
- How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?
- What did you build with this technology? (demo)

Generally, when learning a new technology, it is important to maximize usefulness while minimizing difficulty. Consider making a sorted "hit-list" with these two factors in mind.

>It is advised to pick something that will be relevant to project 4 if you have a clear idea of something you want to build that is out of the scope of material we learned.
